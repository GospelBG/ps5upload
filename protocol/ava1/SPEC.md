# AVA1 wire protocol, version 1 (normative)

AVA1 = Adaptive Verified Assembly. Design rationale: ps5upload-docs
`superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-ava1-transfer-protocol-design.md`. Implementations:
`engine/crates/ava1` (Rust), `payload/ava1` (C). Both must pass `protocol/ava1/vectors/`.

## 1. Transport
TCP, port 9120. A session is one control connection (lane 0) plus up to 8 data
connections (lanes 1..=8). Integers are little-endian.

## 2. Frame header
16 bytes: `"A1"` (0x41 0x31), type u8, flags u8, channel u32, body_len u32,
CRC32C (Castagnoli, reflected, init/xorout 0xFFFFFFFF) of bytes 0..11 as u32.
body_len ≤ 16 MiB (receivers may enforce a lower cap: 64 KiB on control
connections). Bad magic or CRC: close the connection. Flags: bit 0 SEALED (the
body is AEAD ciphertext + 16-byte MAC, §4.4), bit 1 IGNORABLE (a receiver that
does not know the type skips the frame).

## 3. Message encoding
Messages are defined in `schema/ava1.toml` and generated for each language by
`ava1-gen`; never hand-encode. A body is the message's fixed fields in schema
order — u8/u16/u32/u64 little-endian; b16/b32 raw; bytes = u32 length + bytes;
str = u16 length + UTF-8 — followed by an extension block: u16 count, then per
extension u16 tag, u32 value length, value (encoded as a field of its type).
Encoders write extensions in ascending tag order. Decoders skip unknown tags,
reject a repeated known tag, reject invalid UTF-8, and reject trailing bytes
(both in the body and inside an extension value). The canonical encodings in
`vectors/messages.txt` must round-trip byte for byte.
