# AVA1 wire protocol, version 1 (normative)

AVA1 = Adaptive Verified Assembly. Design rationale: ps5upload-docs
`superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-ava1-transfer-protocol-design.md`. Implementations:
`engine/crates/ava1` (Rust), `payload/ava1` (C). Both must pass `protocol/ava1/vectors/`.

## 1. Transport
TCP, port 9120. A session is one control connection (lane 0) plus up to 8 data
connections (lanes 1..=8). Integers are little-endian.

## 2. Frame header
16 bytes: `"A1"` (0x41 0x31), type u8, flags u8, channel u32, body_len u32,
CRC32C (Castagnoli, reflected, init/xorout 0xFFFFFFFF) of bytes 0..11 as u32.
body_len ≤ 16 MiB (receivers may enforce a lower cap: 64 KiB on control
connections). Bad magic or CRC: close the connection. Flags: bit 0 SEALED (the
body is AEAD ciphertext + 16-byte MAC, §4.4), bit 1 IGNORABLE (a receiver that
does not know the type skips the frame).

## 3. Message encoding
Messages are defined in `schema/ava1.toml` and generated for each language by
`ava1-gen`; never hand-encode. A body is the message's fixed fields in schema
order — u8/u16/u32/u64 little-endian; b16/b32 raw; bytes = u32 length + bytes;
str = u16 length + UTF-8 — followed by an extension block: u16 count, then per
extension u16 tag, u32 value length, value (encoded as a field of its type).
Encoders write extensions in ascending tag order. Decoders skip unknown tags,
reject a repeated known tag, reject invalid UTF-8, and reject trailing bytes
(both in the body and inside an extension value). The canonical encodings in
`vectors/messages.txt` must round-trip byte for byte.

## 4. Keys and sealing
4.1 Identity: a static X25519 key pair per node.

4.2 Handshake: `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b` (Noise revision 34), prologue
"AVA1 v1"; the client is the initiator. Implementations must reproduce
`vectors/noise_xx.json` (from the cacophony set). After message 3, Split() gives
c2s (initiator → responder) and s2c; `h` is the handshake hash.

4.3 Lane keys: lane_key(dir, n, cn, sn) = BLAKE2b-256(key = dir, "AVA1 lane" ‖
u16le(n) ‖ cn ‖ sn), where cn and sn are the 16-byte client and server nonces of
the lane's join (§9). Both are fresh random per join, so a re-join of lane n — or a
replayed Join, even one the server no longer remembers — never gets a key already
used with counters restarted at 0. The control connection is lane 0, keyed once per
handshake, with cn = sn = 16 zero bytes. `vectors/keys.txt` pins these derivations.

4.4 Sealed frames: body = ChaCha20-Poly1305(lane key of this direction, nonce =
4 zero bytes ‖ u64le(counter), AD = header bytes 0..11) followed by the 16-byte
MAC; the counter is per lane and direction from 0. A frame that fails to open
closes the connection.

4.5 Join proofs: BLAKE2b-128(key = BLAKE2b-256(key = dir, "AVA1 join"), m):
the Join tag uses dir = c2s and m = "join" ‖ session_id ‖ u16le(lane) ‖ cn; the
JoinAck tag uses dir = s2c and m = "join-ack" ‖ session_id ‖ u16le(lane) ‖ cn ‖ sn.

4.6 Pairing code: u32le(BLAKE2b-256("AVA1 pairing" ‖ h)[0..4]) mod 10⁶, shown as
six digits. A man in the middle yields different h, so different codes.

## 5. Handshake and pairing
1. Client → `Hs1{noise}` (unsealed): Noise message 1, payload `HelloInfo`
   (version range, caps 0).
2. Server: no common version → `Error(ERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION)` unsealed, close.
   Else → `Hs2{noise}`: message 2, payload `ServerInfo` (version, caps, random
   session_id, name).
3. Client → `Hs3{noise}`: message 3, payload `ClientInfo` (name). Both sides
   now key lane 0 (§4.3) and every further frame is sealed.
4. The server learned the client's key in message 3. Unknown key and pairing
   closed → sealed `Error(ERR_PAIRING_CLOSED)`, close. Else → sealed
   `Welcome{knows_you}`.
5. Pairing: while either side does not know the other, both show the pairing
   code (§4.6). After the user confirms, a client whose server sent knows_you = 0
   sends `PairConfirm` (channel = request id); the server answers
   `PairResult{accepted}` on the same channel, accepting only while its pairing
   window is open and its owner approves, then stores the client's key; a key
   that cannot be stored is not accepted. Until accepted, RPCs answer
   `ERR_NOT_PAIRED` and lanes are refused. A client sends nothing but
   `PairConfirm` (no RPC, no Join) while either side is unconfirmed: until the
   user has compared the codes, the server is unverified.
6. Pairing window: opens by itself for 5 minutes after start only while the node
   has no paired peer; otherwise `pairing.open` (method 2, body `PairingOpen`,
   ≤ 600 s) from a paired session opens it. Either kind of window closes as soon
   as one pairing succeeds. A session welcomed with knows_you = 0 that has not
   been accepted ends — sealed `Error(ERR_PAIRING_CLOSED)`, close — when the
   window closes or 60 s after its Welcome, whichever is first. At most 2 such
   sessions exist at a time; a third unknown client gets `Error(ERR_BUSY)` in
   place of Welcome. A node shows at most one pairing request per 10 s.
7. Peer stores: `<64 hex key> <unix seconds> <name>` per line, ≤ 32 peers (oldest
   dropped), written atomically (temp file + rename in the same directory). A
   missing file is an empty store. A file that exists but cannot be read is not:
   the node runs, knows no peers, logs the failure, never opens its automatic
   window, accepts no pairing, and never writes the file.

5.1 Trust slot: the payload ELF carries a 64-byte array — "AVA1TRUST" (9 bytes),
state (0 empty, 1 stamped), 6 zero bytes, 32-byte X25519 key, 16 zero bytes. An
engine sending the ELF writes state 1 and its key into the single slot; the
payload adds that key to its peers at startup. Exactly one slot must exist.

## 6. Liveness
Every connection sends `Ping{seq, t_us}` every 2 s (default) on channel 0, also
while it is in the middle of reading a large frame; the receiver answers `Pong`
with the same values; the sender's RTT is now − t_us. A sender may skip a Ping or
Pong while other frames are queued: they are proof of life too.

Liveness counts bytes, not frames: a connection is dead after 6 s (default,
`dead_after`) with no byte received, so a 16 MiB frame on a slow link is never
mistaken for silence. Each frame must also move at no less than a rate floor
(default 8 KiB/s) after a `dead_after` grace — its deadline is dead_after +
body_len / floor — so a peer cannot drip one frame forever. Writes obey the same
two limits: a peer that takes no bytes for `dead_after` (it stopped reading), or
takes one frame slower than the floor, has its connection closed. A reader never
waits on a socket write: replies are queued to the connection's writer (bounded),
and a peer whose replies back up is disconnected.

Clocks are monotonic. A server closes a connection whose handshake (first byte
to Welcome) does not finish within the handshake timeout (10 s default). `Bye`
ends a session; `Error` reports why and ends the connection.

## 7. RPC
`RpcRequest{method, body}` on the control connection, channel = request id
(chosen by the client, unique among its outstanding requests). The server
answers `RpcResponse{status, body}` on the same channel. status 0 = OK; error
statuses are the `ERR_*` constants. Methods: 1 = node.info → body `NodeInfo`.

## 8. Limits
A server accepts at most 64 connections, 12 from one source address, and 16
sessions (2 of them unconfirmed, §5); past any of these it sends
`Error(ERR_BUSY)` and closes. The accept loop never stops on an accept error.

## 9. Data lanes
A client opens lane n (1..=8) by connecting and sending, unsealed,
`Join{session_id, lane_id, client_nonce, tag}` with a fresh random client_nonce
and the Join tag of §4.5. The server refuses (`Error(ERR_BAD_JOIN)`) an unknown
session, a lane id outside 1..=8, a wrong tag, or a client_nonce it has seen in
this session's last 64 joins; and `ERR_NOT_PAIRED` while the session is not
paired. Otherwise it draws a fresh random server_nonce and sends, unsealed,
`JoinAck{lane_id, server_nonce, tag}` (JoinAck tag, §4.5); the client checks the
tag. Both sides then seal everything after with lane_key(c2s|s2c, n, client_nonce,
server_nonce) (§4.3), counters from 0. A join of a lane id that is
still live supersedes the older connection. Lanes end with their session.
In version 1 project 1, lanes carry only heartbeats.

## 10. Version 1 scope
Project 1 (this spec): framing, codecs, keys, handshake, pairing, trust slot,
heartbeats, RPC `node.info`, data lanes carrying heartbeats only. Not yet in
version 1: data frames, jobs, journals, resume, bundles (project 2); Ed25519
signing keys and tickets, cross-network encryption, session parking (project 2);
management RPCs replacing FTX2 (project 3). Unknown frame types on a control
connection are a protocol error; new frame types require a version bump or a
negotiated `caps` bit.
