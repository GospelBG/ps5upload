# AVA1 wire protocol, version 1 (normative)

AVA1 = Adaptive Verified Assembly. Design rationale: ps5upload-docs
`superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-ava1-transfer-protocol-design.md`. Implementations:
`engine/crates/ava1` (Rust), `payload/ava1` (C). Both must pass `protocol/ava1/vectors/`.

## 1. Transport
TCP, port 9120. A session is one control connection (lane 0) plus up to 8 data
connections (lanes 1..=8). Integers are little-endian.

## 2. Frame header
16 bytes: `"A1"` (0x41 0x31), type u8, flags u8, channel u32, body_len u32,
CRC32C (Castagnoli, reflected, init/xorout 0xFFFFFFFF) of bytes 0..11 as u32.
body_len ≤ 16 MiB (receivers may enforce a lower cap: 64 KiB on control
connections). Bad magic or CRC: close the connection. Flags: bit 0 SEALED (the
body is AEAD ciphertext + 16-byte MAC, §4.4), bit 1 IGNORABLE (a receiver that
does not know the type skips the frame).

## 3. Message encoding
Messages are defined in `schema/ava1.toml` and generated for each language by
`ava1-gen`; never hand-encode. A body is the message's fixed fields in schema
order — u8/u16/u32/u64 little-endian; b16/b32 raw; bytes = u32 length + bytes;
str = u16 length + UTF-8 — followed by an extension block: u16 count, then per
extension u16 tag, u32 value length, value (encoded as a field of its type).
Encoders write extensions in ascending tag order. Decoders skip unknown tags,
reject a repeated known tag, reject invalid UTF-8, and reject trailing bytes
(both in the body and inside an extension value). The canonical encodings in
`vectors/messages.txt` must round-trip byte for byte.

## 4. Keys and sealing
4.1 Identity: a static X25519 key pair per node.

4.2 Handshake: `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b` (Noise revision 34), prologue
"AVA1 v1"; the client is the initiator. Implementations must reproduce
`vectors/noise_xx.json` (from the cacophony set). After message 3, Split() gives
c2s (initiator → responder) and s2c; `h` is the handshake hash.

4.3 Lane keys: lane_key(dir, n) = BLAKE2b-256(key = dir, "AVA1 lane" ‖ u16le(n));
lane 0 is the control connection.

4.4 Sealed frames: body = ChaCha20-Poly1305(lane key of this direction, nonce =
4 zero bytes ‖ u64le(counter), AD = header bytes 0..11) followed by the 16-byte
MAC; the counter is per lane and direction from 0. A frame that fails to open
closes the connection.

4.5 Join proofs: BLAKE2b-128(key = BLAKE2b-256(key = dir, "AVA1 join"),
label ‖ session_id ‖ u16le(lane) ‖ nonce), label "join" with c2s, "join-ack"
with s2c.

4.6 Pairing code: u32le(BLAKE2b-256("AVA1 pairing" ‖ h)[0..4]) mod 10⁶, shown as
six digits. A man in the middle yields different h, so different codes.

## 5. Handshake and pairing
1. Client → `Hs1{noise}` (unsealed): Noise message 1, payload `HelloInfo`
   (version range, caps 0).
2. Server: no common version → `Error(ERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION)` unsealed, close.
   Else → `Hs2{noise}`: message 2, payload `ServerInfo` (version, caps, random
   session_id, name).
3. Client → `Hs3{noise}`: message 3, payload `ClientInfo` (name). Both sides
   now key lane 0 (§4.3) and every further frame is sealed.
4. The server learned the client's key in message 3. Unknown key and pairing
   closed → sealed `Error(ERR_PAIRING_CLOSED)`, close. Else → sealed
   `Welcome{knows_you}`.
5. Pairing: while either side does not know the other, both show the pairing
   code (§4.6). After the user confirms, a client whose server sent knows_you = 0
   sends `PairConfirm` (channel = request id); the server answers
   `PairResult{accepted}` on the same channel, accepting only while its pairing
   window is open and its owner approves, then stores the client's key. Until
   accepted, RPCs answer `ERR_NOT_PAIRED` and lanes are refused.
6. Pairing window: opens by itself for 5 minutes after start only while the node
   has no paired peer; otherwise `pairing.open` (method 2, body `PairingOpen`,
   ≤ 600 s) from a paired session opens it.
7. Peer stores: `<64 hex key> <unix seconds> <name>` per line, ≤ 32 peers (oldest
   dropped), written atomically (temp file + rename in the same directory).

5.1 Trust slot: the payload ELF carries a 64-byte array — "AVA1TRUST" (9 bytes),
state (0 empty, 1 stamped), 6 zero bytes, 32-byte X25519 key, 16 zero bytes. An
engine sending the ELF writes state 1 and its key into the single slot; the
payload adds that key to its peers at startup. Exactly one slot must exist.
